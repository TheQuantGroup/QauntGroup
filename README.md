# Quantitative Genetic Epidemiology Group

The Quantitative Omic Epidemiology Group ("Quant Group") is a collaborative research group established to advance the application of statistical and quantitative omic epidemiology to biomedical data. The group integrates expertise in quantitative methods, biological interpretation, and clinical application to ensure that analyses remain biologically informed and clinically relevant.  

The group is committed to bridging quantitative analysis with an understanding of underlying biological mechanisms, recognising that critical domain knowledge is essential for building robust and interpretable models, including those using artificial intelligence.  

The Quant Group is founded by Dylan Lawless. Membership is collaborative and flexible, comprising invited researchers contributing to specific projects, publications, and shared resources. Leadership and overall coordination remain with the founder.
Membership is project-based and flexible, with researchers joining for individual collaborations and invited as authors on any resulting publications. Members are not subject to formal obligations or restrictions beyond standard authorship practices.

Outputs may be published under the groupâ€™s name, with contributing authors individually named and contributions detailed in each publication.
